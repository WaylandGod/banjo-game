==========

C# game framework focused on being data-driven, testable. Uses Unity3D for input and rendering, but should be easily adaptable to XNA and other frameworks. Since Unity3D now supports all platforms I'm interested in developing this is now just an experiment.

This is forked from my eyeblock tinker project and has been adapted to build from MonoDevelop with tests run in NUnit (eyeblock was Visual Studio and MSTest). Currently tested building in MonoDevelop on ArchLinux with the Unity Editor running in wine.
